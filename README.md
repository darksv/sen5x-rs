# Sensirion I2C SEN5x Driver

This library provides an embedded `no_std` driver for the [Sensirion SEN5x series](https://developer.sensirion.com/sensirion-products/sen5x-environmental-sensor-node/).
This driver was built using [embedded-hal](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/) traits.
The implementation is based on [scd4x-rs](https://github.com/hauju/scd4x-rs) and [sgpc3-rs](https://github.com/mjaakkol/sgpc3-rs).

This driver is compatible with `embedded-hal v1.0`.

## Sensirion SEN5x

The SEN5x is a environmental sensor node for HVAC and air quality applications. It measures
particulate matter (e.g. PM 2.5), VOC, NOx, humidity, and temperature.
